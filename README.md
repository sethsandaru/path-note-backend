# Passing Through Note Backend/Server-side - Presented by Seth Phat¬©
Because my note has been implemented the SPA(Single-Page Application). 
Obviously, we need to have a Backend/Server-side providing data for the Frontend/Client-side.

RESTFul APIs will be the main communication of the product. It always nice to use RESTFul APIs since the Mobile App can re-use
the APIs. I'm always doing my best to make it reusable.
